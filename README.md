# Git-Bro: GitHub PR AI Code Reviewer

**Git-Bro** is a Spring Boot application that performs automated code review on GitHub pull requests using AI models like CodeBERT or ChatGPT. It ingests git diffs, analyzes them chunk-by-chunk, and returns meaningful feedback about potential bugs, style violations, or other code issues.

---

## Features

-  Git diff ingestion and chunking  
-  AI-powered code analysis using CodeBERT (or plug in ChatGPT)  
-  Persistence via Spring Data JPA (H2 in-memory DB)  
-  Asynchronous processing using virtual threads  
-  Feedback is saved to disk for auditing  
-  Pluggable AI client architecture for CodeBERT, OpenAI, or others  

---

## AI Model Selection

This application supports dynamic selection of the AI model used for code analysis. The desired model is specified as an input parameter in the POST request to the `/api/review/analyze-file-by-line` endpoint.

Currently supported models:
-   `chatgpt`: Utilizes the OpenAI ChatGPT API for code analysis.
-   `gemini`: Utilizes the Google Gemini API for code analysis.

To specify the model, include a `modelName` parameter in your request with one of the supported values.

## Data Model: Review vs. ReviewIteration

In this application, we distinguish between `ReviewIteration` and `Review` to accurately model the code review process:

-   **`ReviewIteration`**: Represents a single, complete run of the AI code review process for a specific pull request. Each `ReviewIteration` is uniquely identified by the pull request ID and the commit SHA it was run against. It acts as a container for all individual review comments generated during that particular analysis.

-   **`Review`**: Represents an individual AI-generated comment or issue found during a `ReviewIteration`. Each `Review` is associated with a specific `ReviewIteration` and contains details such as the file name, the line number, the comment itself, and a derived severity score.

Essentially, one `ReviewIteration` can contain multiple `Review` objects, providing a historical record of all AI feedback for each analysis run on a pull request.

## How GitHub JWT Tokens are Retrieved Programmatically

  ### Why Do I need one?
  GitHub JWT Tokens are required for every request made to GitHub. This app needs to do that a lot.

  ### How Do I do that?

  Retreive a PEM file from GitHub.

  ### How Does It Work in the Code?
  Load the GitHub App private key from PEM file.

  PEM files contain Base64-encoded key data, wrapped in header/footer lines.
  We strip the BEGIN/END headers, then decode the Base64 body to obtain DER-encoded key bytes.
  
  I included stripping the headers in code, in case I forget to manually remove them.
  
  To get this working with Java's KeyFactory, the private key must be in PKCS#8 format.
  The private key you download from GitHub IS already PKCS#8, so **you do not need to convert it** ‚Äî 
  unless you've manually generated keys elsewhere (like OpenSSL) in PKCS#1 format.
  
  If you DO need to convert a PKCS#1 private key to PKCS#8, use this command:
  openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in my_rsa_github_pem.pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem
  
  Additionally, to generate the corresponding public key (optional for constructing some JWT libraries):
  openssl rsa -in gitbro-ai-platform.2025-06-17.private-key.pem -pubout -out gitbro-public-key.pem
  
  Now you should have a valid private key (PKCS#8) and public key (PEM).
  These keys are needed to build the JWT for GitHub App authentication, typically done using Nimbus JOSE JWT.
   
## NGrok
Ngrok is a virtual server I use for deployment. It's handy for testing GitHub workflows on a "local server" from github. 
Run 
```
ngrok http 8080 
```
to start the server. Then, copy and paste it into the work flow step "Call Code Review Api"
```

       API_URL: https://1102-149-154-20-92.ngrok-free.app/api/review/analyze-file
```

## DATABASE
For local development, I'm using a non-ephemeral Postgres database. Originally, I was using H2, but needed something that would last longer.
Below is the command to start the database. Make sure you have Docker installed.

```yaml
docker compose -f docker-compose-test-db.yml up -d
```
